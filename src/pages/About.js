        <p>
          Hi! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at <strong>Pamantasan ng Cabuyao</strong>, currently exploring the exciting world of software development.  
          This portfolio is part of my <strong>CCS112: Applications Development and Emerging Technologies</strong> course, showcasing my skills, projects, and personal growth journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          While still gaining experience in <strong>frontend development with React</strong> and <strong>backend development with Laravel</strong>, I enjoy building projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.  
          I’m always eager to learn new technologies, best practices, and ways to improve my craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          I value creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration. I approach challenges with curiosity and a growth mindset, aiming to improve continuously.
        </p>
